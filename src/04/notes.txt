# Scratchcards

Winning card numbers
Each line contains two sets of numbers
The first set of N numbers show the winning numbers
The second set of M numbers show the given numbers

You get points according to a formula like: 2^(W-1)
Where W denotes the number of set M included in set N
1 win = 2^(1-1) = 1
2 wins = 2^(2-1) = 2
3 wins = 2^(3-1) = 4
4 wins = 2^(4-1) = 8
5 wins = 2^(5-1) = 16 and so on...
